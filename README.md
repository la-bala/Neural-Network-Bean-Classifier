### How to run the program
In a terminal, execute:\
python NeuralNet-2.py

Make sure all libraries used, listed below, are installed.\

Results of each model are printed to standard output as well as included in a outputtable.csv file created after the program is run. Each run will update outputtable.csv.\
Before the program ends the plot of model history will appear in a new window. The program ends once you close this plot.

### Results summary
x activation function performed the best and y is why we think so. a b c other hyperparameters performed the best.

### Where is the dataset from?
The dataset was found from the UCI open datasets repository at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset, credit: KOKLU, M. and OZKAN, I.A., (2020), Multiclass Classification of Dry Beans Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning Techniques. Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 174, 105507. Building real estate valuation models with comparative approach through case-based reasoning. Applied Soft Computing, 65, 260-271.

Uploaded to a public s3 bucket, dataset should download to memory automatically when run.
